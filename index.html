      <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
      <p><strong>“One of the harshest places on earth.”</strong> That’s not hyperbole.</p>
      <p>
        As a landlocked country in the Sahel region of West Africa, Mali faces relentless heat and long seasons of drought. During the day, there’s hardly any escape from the sun. And that’s especially true if you bear the responsibility of finding water for your family.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “We’ve heard some poignant stories: Entire villages having disappeared. We’ve seen people go blind digging wells. People have died going out in search of water. It’s been very difficult for women.” <br><br>
        <em>— Fatou Bintou Gariko, WASH Specialist, World Vision Mali</em>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Communities that don’t have access to clean water often rely on 800-year-old holes in the ground outside their village—contaminated sources that they share with neighboring communities. Women from all over come to wait in line for hours each day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only is it incredibly time-consuming, but it’s also tedious and physically demanding work.
